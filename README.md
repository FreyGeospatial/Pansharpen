# Pansharpen

Data fusion is the action of combining different modes of data into a single output. In satellite remote sensing, pansharpening is used to increase the spatial resolution of imagery by fusing the higher resolution panchromatic band to the lower resolution multispectral imagery.

The R and Python scripts scripts in this repository illustrate some simple pansharpening methods in remote sensing data fusion. One script attempts to follow the Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS) method described in the TerrSet/Idrisi help guide. The other is a Brovey pansharpening method described in remote sensing scientific literature.
