# Pansharpen
These scripts illustrate some simple pansharpening methods in data fusion.

One attempts to follow the Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS) method described in the TerrSet/Idrisi help guide.

The other is a Brovey pansharpening method described in remote sensing scientific literature.

Pansharpening is often used to increase the spatial resolution of remotely sensed imagery by fusing the higher resolution panchromatic band to the lower resolution multispectral imagery.
