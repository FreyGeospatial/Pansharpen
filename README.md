# Pansharpen
Open source alternative to the TerrSet/Idrisi PANSHARPEN module, using the intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) method. 

Pansharpening is often used to increase the spatial resolution of remotely sensed imagery by fusing the higher resolution panchromatic band to the lower resolution multispectral imagery.
